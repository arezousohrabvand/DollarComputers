Multi-form project that simulates a computer purchase. The program initially gives the user an option to 'start a new order' or 'load a saved order'. If the user selects 'start a new order' the program allows the user to select computer hardware from a dynamic grid generated from a database connection. The user will then select computer hardware from a formcontrol. The selected hardware components will display on a separate form and the user will have the option to save the configuration to a file. If the user selects 'load a saved order' the program displays a dialog box that allows the user to load a previously saved hardware configuration. The application will then calculate the cost of the Computer (including taxes) in a separate form
